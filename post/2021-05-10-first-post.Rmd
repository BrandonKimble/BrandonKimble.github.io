I am typing a bunch of nonsense lalalala lorem ipsum. Oh yeah... here's a link to my project!
[Link to project 1](/project/project1/)

Also, I'm going to show you how the reticulate package works in R! Excited? Yeah me too.
So, you load it up with this...
```{R}
library(reticulate)
hi<-"Hello"
```

Then, you add a python chunk and incorporate the R code like so... 
```{python}
hi = "world"
print(r.hi,hi)
```
And, that's all she wrote!
